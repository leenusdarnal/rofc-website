		including Pre-Primary Teachers (PPT), Primary Teachers (PRT), Graduate Teachers (GT), Post
		Graduate Teachers (PGT), Head Masters (HMPS, HMJHS, HMSS), and also the Principals. With the
		main focus to build a strong umbrella association comprising all categories of teachers from PPT

		Through extensive user research, we discovered that teachers in Sikkim wern't able to
		communicate their griviences to the centralized Association easily. The Sikkim Teachers
		Association Wanted a unified platform where Teachers all across Sikkim were allowed to become
		members and all the teachers who become the members could address their griviences to the
		central executive body of STA. The Teacher Association Also Wanted an integrated Payment Gateway
		to their Website so that membership fees could be collected directly via the web portal which
		earlier had to be done manually by an STA member.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-10 text-lg">
		The end result is a user-friendly platform where teachers can become the Members of the STA and
		resolve their griviences and discussions online
